# Plexify

Plexify is a [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) extension
which lets you connect to your [Plex](https://plex.tv/) account to check if your
library contains certain media while browsing popular websites like
[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/),
and more! To indicate that your library contains the media, Plexify adds a
small, non-intrusive badge to the page.
